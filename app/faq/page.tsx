    question: 'What does this app do?',
    answer:
      'It exports your (private) liked songs on Spotify into a public playlist, so you can easily share your music taste with others.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do I need to log in with Spotify?',
    answer:
      'Logging in allows us to fetch your liked songs and create a playlist on your behalf. We use the Spotify API and require your user token to do this.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my data safe?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We do not collect or store data. We only use your token to interact with Spotify during the session (which is stored on your device).'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I change the playlist name?',
    answer: "Yes, you can customize the playlist name before it's created."
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I upload a custom cover image?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely! You can upload a custom image to make your playlist look exactly how you want.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Will my liked songs be modified?',
    answer:
      'Nope. Your liked songs stay untouched â€” we only read them to create a new public playlist.'
